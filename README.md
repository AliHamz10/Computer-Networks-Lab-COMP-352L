## Computer Networks Lab (COMP-352L)

This repo contains lab materials, PCAPs, code, and reports for COMP-352L.

### Structure

- `Lab 03/`: Wireshark HTTP analysis PCAPs and screenshots
  - `Screenshots/Question#01.png` to `Question#04.png`
- `Lab 04/`: Socket programming examples (Python)
- `Lab 05/`: Iterated TCP server/client exercises
- `Lab Manuals/`: PDF lab manuals
- `Lab Reports/`: Markdown lab reports

### Lab Report 03

- Report file: `Lab Reports/Lab Report 03.md`
- Screenshots referenced in the report are in `Lab 03/Screenshots/`
  - Only Q1–Q4 include screenshots as available

#### Viewing Tips

- Open the report in a Markdown viewer that supports relative image paths.
- If images don’t render, ensure the directory names with spaces are preserved (e.g., `Lab 03`), or view directly:
  - `Lab 03/Screenshots/Question#01.png`
  - `Lab 03/Screenshots/Question#02.png`
  - `Lab 03/Screenshots/Question#03.png`
  - `Lab 03/Screenshots/Question#04.png`

### Running Lab Code

- Python 3.10+ recommended.
- For Lab 04 and Lab 05 examples:
  - Start a server script (e.g., `python Lab\ 04/echo_server_tcp.py`)
  - In another terminal, run the client (e.g., `python Lab\ 04/echo_client_tcp.py`)

### Lab 04 — Selected Evidence

- Task 05 (greeting behavior):

### Notes

- Keep file names intact, including `#` symbols in screenshot names.
- Prefer relative links in reports for portability.
